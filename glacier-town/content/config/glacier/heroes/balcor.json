That was until the fateful hunting trip with his brother that led to a severe head injury and the title of little brother to Nilgaz. Having learned his lesson, Balcor has become quite the famed Armorer. To this day he can be seen wearing only the finest Iron helmets from his personal collection every time he goes into battle.",
